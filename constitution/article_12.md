5. Charter committee; charter preparation; approval

Section 5. A. The board of supervisors of any county with a
population of more than five hundred thousand persons as determined by the
most recent United States decennial or special census may call for an election
to cause a charter committee to be elected by the qualified electors of that
county at any time. Alternatively, the board of supervisors of any county
with a population of more than five hundred thousand persons as determined by
the most recent United States decennial or special census shall call for the
election of the charter committee within ten days after receipt by the clerk
of the board of supervisors of a petition that demands the election and that
is signed by a number of qualified electors of the county at least equal to
ten per cent of the total number of ballots cast for all candidates for
governor or presidential electors in the county at the last preceding general
election. The election shall be held at least one hundred days but not more
than one hundred twenty days after the call for the election. Except as
otherwise provided in this section, for elections held under this section or
section 6 of this article, the manner of conducting and voting at an election,
contesting an election, canvassing votes and certifying returns shall be the
same, as nearly as practicable, as in elections for county officers.

B. At the election a vote shall be taken to elect members of the
charter committee who will function if further proceedings are authorized and
the ballot shall contain the question of whether further proceedings toward
adopting a charter shall be authorized pursuant to the call for the
election. Unless a majority of the qualified electors voting on the question
votes to authorize further proceedings, the election of members of the charter
committee shall be invalidated and no further proceedings may be had except
pursuant to a subsequent call pursuant to subsection A.

C. The charter committee shall be composed of fifteen qualified
electors of the county elected by supervisorial district with the same number
serving from each district. A nomination petition for election to the charter
committee shall be made available by the clerk of the board of supervisors and
shall be signed by a number of qualified electors of the supervisorial
district who are eligible to vote for the nominee at least equal to one per
cent of the total number of ballots cast for all candidates for governor or
presidential electors in the supervisorial district at the last preceding
general election, and filed with the clerk not later than sixty days before
the election. All qualified electors of the county, including all elected
public officials, are eligible to seek election to the charter committee.

D. Within one hundred eighty days after the election the charter
committee shall prepare and submit a proposed charter for the county. The
proposed charter shall be signed by a majority of the members of the committee
and filed with the clerk of the board of supervisors, after which the charter
committee shall be dissolved. The county shall then publish the proposed
charter in the official newspaper of the county at least once a week for three
consecutive weeks. The first publication shall be made within twenty days
after the proposed charter is filed with the clerk of the board of
supervisors.

E. At least forty-five days but not more than sixty days after final
publication, the proposed charter shall be submitted to the vote of the
qualified electors of the county at a general or special election. If a
general election will be held within ninety days after final publication, the
charter shall be submitted at that general election. The full text of the
proposed charter shall be printed in a publicity pamphlet and mailed to each
household containing a registered voter at least eleven days before the
charter election and the ballot may contain only a summary of the proposed
charter provisions. The ballot shall contain a question regarding approval of
the proposed charter and the questions pertaining to taxation authority and
appointment of officers, if any, provided for in sections 7 and 8 of this
article.

F. If a majority of the qualified electors voting ratifies the proposed
charter, a copy of the charter, together with a statement setting forth the
submission of the charter to the qualified electors and its ratification by
them, shall be certified by the clerk of the board of supervisors and shall be
submitted to the governor for approval. The governor shall approve the
charter within thirty days after its submission if it is not in conflict with,
or states that in the event of a conflict is subject to, this constitution and
the laws of this state. On approval, the charter becomes the organic law of
the county, and certified copies of the charter shall be filed in the office
of the secretary of state and with the clerk of the board of supervisors after
being recorded in the office of the county recorder. Thereafter all courts
shall take judicial notice of the charter.

6. Amendment of charter

Section 6. A charter shall set forth procedures for amendment
of the charter. Proposed amendments shall be submitted to the qualified
electors of the county at a general or special election and become effective
if ratified by a majority of the qualified electors voting on the amendments
and approved by the governor in the manner provided for in section 5 of this
article.

7. County charter provisions

Section 7. A. Charter counties continue to be political
subdivisions of this state that exist to aid in the administration of this
state's laws and for purposes of self-government. Except as otherwise
provided in this article the powers of the legislature over counties are not
affected by this section and sections 5, 6, 8 and 9 of this article. Charter
counties shall provide the same state mandated services and perform the same
state mandated functions as non-charter counties. Charter counties may
exercise, if provided by the charter, all powers over local concerns of the
county consistent with, and subject to, the constitution and the laws of this
state. In matters of strictly local municipal concern, charters adopted
pursuant to article XIII shall control in any case of conflict with a county
charter adopted pursuant to this article.

B. If a county has framed and adopted a charter and the charter is
approved by the governor as provided in this article, the county shall be
governed by the terms of its charter and ordinances passed pursuant to its
charter. If the charter has been framed, adopted and approved and any of its
provisions are in conflict with any county ordinance, rule or regulation
relating to local concerns of the counties in force at the time of the
adoption and approval of the charter, the provisions of the charter prevail
notwithstanding the conflict and operate as a repeal or suspension of the law
to the extent of conflict, and the law is not thereafter operative as to such
conflict.

C. Notwithstanding article IX, section 1, if proposed and approved in
the charter, a charter county may levy and collect:

1.  Taxes on a countywide basis to provide services on a countywide
    basis.

2.  Taxes on a specially designated area basis to provide services or
    special levels of service to that area.

All taxes levied pursuant to this subsection shall be uniform upon the
same class of property within the territorial limits of the county or the
specially designated area and shall be levied and collected for public
purposes only.

D. The decision to include a charter provision authorizing taxation
pursuant to subsection C, paragraph 1 or 2 of this section shall be placed on
the ballot as separate questions at the election to ratify the charter and
must be approved by a majority of the qualified electors voting at the
election. The result of the voting on either provision authorizing taxation
does not affect the result of the voting to ratify the charter. Charter
provisions authorizing taxation pursuant to subsection C, paragraph 1 or 2 of
this section may also be proposed by an amendment to the charter pursuant to
section 6 of this article.

E. If the authority to tax pursuant to subsection C, paragraph 2 of
this section is approved for inclusion in the charter, any new tax proposed by
the county under subsection C, paragraph 2 of this section shall be voted on
by the qualified electors of the specially designated area. The tax must be
ratified by a majority vote of the qualified electors voting at the election.

F. A transaction privilege tax, use tax or similar tax levied by a
county pursuant to subsection C, paragraph 1 of this section:

1.  May be imposed on only those business activities, or on the use,
    storage or consumption, which are subject to the comparable state transaction
    privilege tax, use tax or similar tax.

2.  Shall provide all exclusion and exemptions provided by, and
    administrative provisions consistent with, the comparable state transaction
    privilege tax, use tax or similar tax.

G. All taxes levied under subsection F of this section shall not exceed
an aggregate rate of two per cent when combined with existing taxes levied
pursuant to title 42, chapter 8.3.

H. If approved in the charter, a charter county may adopt fees and fee
schedules for any county products and county service delivery it provides in
the conduct of any official business. Notwithstanding any fee schedules or
individual charges provided by state law, the governing body of a charter
county may adopt an alternate fee schedule or individual charge. Any fee or
charge established pursuant to this section shall be attributable to and
defray or cover the current or future costs of the product or service delivery
for which the fee or charge is assessed.

I. Taxes raised under the authority of this section shall be subject to
the provisions of the county property tax and expenditure limitations pursuant
to article IX, sections 19 and 20.

8. Government and other powers

Section 8. A. The county charter shall provide:

1.  For an elective governing body and its method of compensation, its
    powers, duties and responsibilities, its authority to delegate powers, the
    method of election and removal of members, the terms of office and the manner
    of filling vacancies in the governing body.

2.  For all officers established under section 3 of this article and
    article VI, section 23, and such additional officers as the charter may
    provide for, their election or appointment, consolidation or segregation,
    method of compensation, powers, duties and responsibilities, authority to
    delegate powers and, if elected, the method of election and removal, terms of
    office and the manner of filling vacancies in such offices. If the charter
    provides for the attorney to remain an elective officer of the county, the
    charter may provide for an appointive office to carry out the civil
    representation needs of the county, its departments, agencies, boards,
    commissions, officials and employees. If the elective governing body provided
    for in the charter does not consist of supervisors, the charter may provide
    for elimination of the office of supervisor. If the charter provides for the
    office of supervisor, the number of supervisors shall be not fewer than five
    or greater than nine. If the charter provides for the appointment or
    elimination of an officer established under section 3 of this article or
    article VI, section 23, or for an appointive office to carry out the civil
    representation needs of the county, those provisions shall include an
    effective date not earlier than the expiration of the term of office for the
    officer commencing in January immediately following the first general election
    at which the officer is elected following approval of the charter by the
    voters and shall be placed on the ballot as separate questions at the election
    to ratify the charter and must be approved by a majority of the qualified
    electors voting at the election. The result of the voting on any provisions
    authorizing appointment or elimination of officers does not affect the result
    of the voting to ratify the charter.

3.  For the performance of functions required by statute.

4.  For a periodic review of the charter provisions to be conducted at
    least once every ten years from the time of its ratification by the voters and
    the procedures for the periodic review.

B. The county charter may provide for other elective and appointive
offices.

9. Self-executing provision

Section 9. The provisions of sections 5 through 8 of this
article are self-executing, and no further legislation is required to make
them effective.
