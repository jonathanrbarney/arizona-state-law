1. Power of impeachment in house of representatives;
   trial by senate

Section 1. The house of representatives shall have the sole
power of impeachment. The concurrence of a majority of all the members shall
be necessary to an impeachment. All impeachments shall be tried by the
senate, and, when sitting for that purpose, the senators shall be upon oath or
affirmation to do justice according to law and evidence, and shall be presided
over by the chief justice of the supreme court. Should the chief justice be
on trial, or otherwise disqualified, the senate shall elect a judge of the
supreme court to preside.

2. Conviction; grounds for impeachment; judgment;
   liability to trial

Section 2. No person shall be convicted without a concurrence
of two-thirds of the senators elected. The governor and other state and
judicial officers, except justices of courts not of record, shall be liable to
impeachment for high crimes, misdemeanors, or malfeasance in office, but
judgment in such cases shall extend only to removal from office and
disqualification to hold any office of honor, trust, or profit in the
state. The party, whether convicted or acquitted, shall, nevertheless, be
liable to trial and punishment according to law.
