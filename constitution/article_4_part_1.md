1. Legislative authority; initiative and referendum

Section 1. (1) Senate; house of representatives; reservation
of power to people. The legislative authority of the state shall be vested in
the legislature, consisting of a senate and a house of representatives, but
the people reserve the power to propose laws and amendments to the
constitution and to enact or reject such laws and amendments at the polls,
independently of the legislature; and they also reserve, for use at their own
option, the power to approve or reject at the polls any act, or item, section,
or part of any act, of the legislature.

(2) Initiative power. The first of these reserved powers is the
initiative. Under this power ten per centum of the qualified electors shall
have the right to propose any measure, and fifteen per centum shall have the
right to propose any amendment to the constitution.

(3) Referendum power; emergency measures; effective date of acts. The
second of these reserved powers is the referendum. Under this power the
legislature, or five per centum of the qualified electors, may order the
submission to the people at the polls of any measure, or item, section, or
part of any measure, enacted by the legislature, except laws immediately
necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or for
the support and maintenance of the departments of the state government and
state institutions; but to allow opportunity for referendum petitions, no act
passed by the legislature shall be operative for ninety days after the close
of the session of the legislature enacting such measure, except such as
require earlier operation to preserve the public peace, health, or safety, or
to provide appropriations for the support and maintenance of the departments
of the state and of state institutions; provided, that no such emergency
measure shall be considered passed by the legislature unless it shall state in
a separate section why it is necessary that it shall become immediately
operative, and shall be approved by the affirmative votes of two-thirds of the
members elected to each house of the legislature, taken by roll call of ayes
and nays, and also approved by the governor; and should such measure be vetoed
by the governor, it shall not become a law unless it shall be approved by the
votes of three-fourths of the members elected to each house of the
legislature, taken by roll call of ayes and nays.

(4) Initiative and referendum petitions; filing. All petitions
submitted under the power of the initiative shall be known as initiative
petitions, and shall be filed with the secretary of state not less than four
months preceding the date of the election at which the measures so proposed
are to be voted upon. All petitions submitted under the power of the
referendum shall be known as referendum petitions, and shall be filed with the
secretary of state not more than ninety days after the final adjournment of
the session of the legislature which shall have passed the measure to which
the referendum is applied. The filing of a referendum petition against any
item, section, or part of any measure shall not prevent the remainder of such
measure from becoming operative.

(5) Effective date of initiative and referendum measures. Any measure
or amendment to the constitution proposed under the initiative, and any
measure to which the referendum is applied, shall be referred to a vote of the
qualified electors, and shall become law when approved by a majority of the
votes cast thereon and upon proclamation of the governor, and not otherwise.

(6) (A) Veto of initiative or referendum. The veto power of the
governor shall not extend to an initiative measure approved by a majority of
the votes cast thereon or to a referendum measure decided by a majority of the
votes cast thereon.

(6) (B) Legislature's power to repeal initiative or referendum. The
legislature shall not have the power to repeal an initiative measure approved
by a majority of the votes cast thereon or to repeal a referendum measure
decided by a majority of the votes cast thereon.

(6) (C) Legislature's power to amend initiative or referendum. The
legislature shall not have the power to amend an initiative measure approved
by a majority of the votes cast thereon, or to amend a referendum measure
decided by a majority of the votes cast thereon, unless the amending
legislation furthers the purposes of such measure and at least three-fourths
of the members of each house of the legislature, by a roll call of ayes and
nays, vote to amend such measure.

(6) (D) Legislature's power to appropriate or divert funds created by
initiative or referendum. The legislature shall not have the power to
appropriate or divert funds created or allocated to a specific purpose by an
initiative measure approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon, or by a
referendum measure decided by a majority of the votes cast thereon, unless the
appropriation or diversion of funds furthers the purposes of such measure and
at least three-fourths of the members of each house of the legislature, by a
roll call of ayes and nays, vote to appropriate or divert such funds.

(7) Number of qualified electors. The whole number of votes cast for
all candidates for governor at the general election last preceding the filing
of any initiative or referendum petition on a state or county measure shall be
the basis on which the number of qualified electors required to sign such
petition shall be computed.

(8) Local, city, town or county matters. The powers of the initiative
and the referendum are hereby further reserved to the qualified electors of
every incorporated city, town, and county as to all local, city, town, or
county matters on which such incorporated cities, towns, and counties are or
shall be empowered by general laws to legislate. Such incorporated cities,
towns, and counties may prescribe the manner of exercising said powers within
the restrictions of general laws. Under the power of the initiative fifteen
per centum of the qualified electors may propose measures on such local, city,
town, or county matters, and ten per centum of the electors may propose the
referendum on legislation enacted within and by such city, town, or county.
Until provided by general law, said cities and towns may prescribe the basis
on which said percentages shall be computed.

(9) Form and contents of initiative and of referendum petitions;
verification. Every initiative or referendum petition shall be addressed to
the secretary of state in the case of petitions for or on state measures, and
to the clerk of the board of supervisors, city clerk, or corresponding officer
in the case of petitions for or on county, city, or town measures; and shall
contain the declaration of each petitioner, for himself, that he is a
qualified elector of the state (and in the case of petitions for or on city,
town, or county measures, of the city, town, or county affected), his post
office address, the street and number, if any, of his residence, and the date
on which he signed such petition. Each sheet containing petitioners'
signatures shall be attached to a full and correct copy of the title and text
of the measure so proposed to be initiated or referred to the people, and
every sheet of every such petition containing signatures shall be verified by
the affidavit of the person who circulated said sheet or petition, setting
forth that each of the names on said sheet was signed in the presence of the
affiant and that in the belief of the affiant each signer was a qualified
elector of the state, or in the case of a city, town, or county measure, of
the city, town, or county affected by the measure so proposed to be initiated
or referred to the people.

(10) Official ballot. When any initiative or referendum petition or any
measure referred to the people by the legislature shall be filed, in
accordance with this section, with the secretary of state, he shall cause to
be printed on the official ballot at the next regular general election the
title and number of said measure, together with the words "yes" and "no" in
such manner that the electors may express at the polls their approval or
disapproval of the measure.

(11) Publication of measures. The text of all measures to be submitted
shall be published as proposed amendments to the constitution are published,
and in submitting such measures and proposed amendments the secretary of state
and all other officers shall be guided by the general law until legislation
shall be especially provided therefor.

(12) Conflicting measures or constitutional amendments. If two or more
conflicting measures or amendments to the constitution shall be approved by
the people at the same election, the measure or amendment receiving the
greatest number of affirmative votes shall prevail in all particulars as to
which there is conflict.

(13) Canvass of votes; proclamation. It shall be the duty of the
secretary of state, in the presence of the governor and the chief justice of
the supreme court, to canvass the votes for and against each such measure or
proposed amendment to the constitution within thirty days after the election,
and upon the completion of the canvass the governor shall forthwith issue a
proclamation, giving the whole number of votes cast for and against each
measure or proposed amendment, and declaring such measures or amendments as
are approved by a majority of those voting thereon to be law.

(14) Reservation of legislative power. This section shall not be
construed to deprive the legislature of the right to enact any measure except
that the legislature shall not have the power to adopt any measure that
supersedes, in whole or in part, any initiative measure approved by a majority
of the votes cast thereon or any referendum measure decided by a majority of
the votes cast thereon unless the superseding measure furthers the purposes of
the initiative or referendum measure and at least three-fourths of the members
of each house of the legislature, by a roll call of ayes and nays, vote to
supersede such initiative or referendum measure.

(15) Legislature's right to refer measure to the people. Nothing in this
section shall be construed to deprive or limit the legislature of the right to
order the submission to the people at the polls of any measure, item, section,
or part of any measure.

(16) Self-executing. This section of the constitution shall be, in all
respects, self-executing.

2. Penalty for violation of initiative and
   referendum provisions

Section 2. The legislature shall provide a penalty for any
wilful violation of any of the provisions of the preceding section.
