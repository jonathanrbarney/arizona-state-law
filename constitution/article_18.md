existing in the state of Arizona, and producing uncertain and unequal
compensation therefor, such employee, engaged in such private employment, may

provisions of such workmen's compensation law prior to the injury, except that
if the injury is the result of an act done by the employer or a person
employed by the employer knowingly and purposely with the direct object of
injuring another, and the act indicates a wilful disregard of the life, limb
or bodily safety of employees, then such employee may, after the injury,
exercise the option to accept compensation or to retain the right to sue the
person who injured him.
