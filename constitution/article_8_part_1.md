1. Officers subject to recall; petitioners

Section 1. Every public officer in the state of Arizona,
holding an elective office, either by election or appointment, is subject to
recall from such office by the qualified electors of the electoral district
from which candidates are elected to such office. Such electoral district may
include the whole state. Such number of said electors as shall equal
twenty-five per centum of the number of votes cast at the last preceding
general election for all of the candidates for the office held by such
officer, may by petition, which shall be known as a recall petition, demand
his recall.

2. Recall petitions; contents; filing; signatures; oath

Section 2. Every recall petition must contain a general statement, in not more than two hundred words, of the grounds of such demand, and must be filed in the office in which petitions for nominations to the office held by the incumbent are required to be filed. The signatures to such recall petition need not all be on one sheet of paper, but each signer must add to his signature the date of his signing said petition, and his place of residence, giving his street and number, if any, should he reside in a town or city. One of the signers of each sheet of such petition, or the person circulating such sheet, must make and subscribe an oath on said sheet, that the signatures thereon are genuine.

3. Resignation of officer; special election

Section 3. If such officer shall offer his resignation it shall
be accepted, and the vacancy shall be filled as may be provided by law. If he
shall not resign within five days after a recall petition is filed as provided
by law, a special election shall be ordered to be held as provided by law, to
determine whether such officer shall be recalled. On the ballots at such
election shall be printed the reasons as set forth in the petition for
demanding his recall, and, in not more than two hundred words, the officer's
justification of his course in office. He shall continue to perform the
duties of his office until the result of such election shall have been
officially declared.

4. Special election; candidates; results;
   qualification of successor

Section 4. Unless the incumbent otherwise requests, in writing,
the incumbent's name shall be placed as a candidate on the official ballot
without nomination. Other candidates for the office may be nominated to be
voted for at said election. The candidate who receives the highest number of
votes shall be declared elected for the remainder of the term. Unless the
incumbent receives the highest number of votes, the incumbent shall be deemed
to be removed from office, upon qualification of the successor. In the event
that the successor shall not qualify within five days after the result of said
election shall have been declared, the said office shall be vacant, and may be
filled as provided by law.

5. Recall petitions; restrictions and conditions

Section 5. No recall petition shall be circulated against any
officer until he shall have held his office for a period of six months, except
that it may be filed against a member of the legislature at any time after
five days from the beginning of the first session after his election. After
one recall petition and election, no further recall petition shall be filed
against the same officer during the term for which he was elected, unless
petitioners signing such petition shall first pay into the public treasury
which has paid such election expenses, all expenses of the preceding election.

6. Application of general election laws;
   implementary legislation

Section 6. The general election laws shall apply to recall
elections in so far as applicable. Laws necessary to facilitate the operation
of the provisions of this article shall be enacted, including provision for
payment by the public treasury of the reasonable special election campaign
expenses of such officer.
