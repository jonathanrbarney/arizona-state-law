20. Expenditure limitation; adjustments; reporting

Section 20. (1) The economic estimates commission shall
determine and publish prior to April 1 of each year the expenditure limitation
for the following fiscal year for each county, city and town. The expenditure
limitations shall be determined by adjusting the amount of actual payments of
local revenues for each such political subdivision for fiscal year 1979-1980
to reflect the changes in the population of each political subdivision and the
cost of living. The governing board of any political subdivision shall not
authorize expenditures of local revenues in excess of the limitation
prescribed in this section, except as provided in subsections (2), (6) and (9)
of this section.

(2) Expenditures in excess of the limitations determined pursuant to
subsection (1) of this section may be authorized as follows:

(a) Upon affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of the governing
board for expenditures directly necessitated by a natural or man-made disaster
declared by the governor. Any expenditures in excess of the expenditure
limitation, as authorized by this paragraph, shall not affect the
determination of the expenditure limitation pursuant to subsection (1) of this
section in any subsequent years. Any expenditures authorized pursuant to this
paragraph shall be made either in the fiscal year in which the disaster is
declared or in the succeeding fiscal year.

(b) Upon the affirmative vote of seventy per cent of the members of the
governing board for expenditures directly necessitated by a natural or
man-made disaster not declared by the governor, subject to the following:

(i) The governing board reducing expenditures below the expenditure
limitation determined pursuant to subsection (1) of this section by the amount
of the excess expenditure for the fiscal year following a fiscal year in which
excess expenditures were made pursuant to this paragraph; or

(ii) Approval of the excess expenditure by a majority of the qualified
electors voting either at a special election held by the governing board or at
a regularly scheduled election for the nomination or election of the members
of the governing board, in the manner provided by law. If the excess
expenditure is not approved by a majority of the qualified electors voting,
the governing board shall for the fiscal year which immediately follows the
fiscal year in which the excess expenditures are made, reduce expenditures
below the expenditure limitation determined pursuant to subsection (1) of this
section by the amount of the excess expenditures. Any expenditures in excess
of the expenditure limitation, as authorized by this paragraph, shall not
affect the determination of the expenditure limitation pursuant to subsection
(1) of this section in any subsequent years. Any expenditures pursuant to
this paragraph shall be made either in the fiscal year in which the disaster
occurs or in the succeeding fiscal year.

(c) Upon affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the members of the
governing board and approval by a majority of the qualified electors voting
either at a special election held by the governing board in a manner
prescribed by law, or at a regularly scheduled election for the nomination or
election of the members of the governing board. Such approval by a majority
of the qualified electors voting shall be for a specific amount in excess of
the expenditure limitation, and such approval must occur prior to the fiscal
year in which the expenditure limitation is to be exceeded. Any expenditures
in excess of the expenditure limitation, as authorized by this subdivision,
shall not affect the determination of the expenditure limitation pursuant to
subsection (1) of this section, in subsequent years.

limitation pursuant to this subsection different from the expenditure
limitation prescribed by subsection (1) of this section. The governing board
of a city or town may by a two-thirds vote provide for referral of an
alternative expenditure limitation or the qualified electors may by
initiative, in the manner provided by law, propose an alternative expenditure
limitation. In a manner provided by law, the impact of the alternative
expenditure limitation shall be compared to the impact of the expenditure
limitation prescribed by subsection (1) of this section, and the comparison

may be submitted to the voters for a period of at least two years. If an
alternative expenditure limitation is adopted pursuant to this subsection, the
city or town may not conduct an override election provided for in section 19,
subsection (4) of this article, during the time period in which the

subsection (1) of this section, by the provisions prescribed by subsections
(2) and (6) of this section, or may adopt an alternative expenditure
limitation pursuant to subsection (9) of this section.
