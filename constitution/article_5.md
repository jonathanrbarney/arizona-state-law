becomes a law, shall be presented to the governor. If he approve, he shall
sign it, and it shall become a law as provided in this constitution. But if
he disapprove, he shall return it, with his objections, to the house in which
it originated, which shall enter the objections at large on the journal. If
after reconsideration it again passes both houses by an aye and nay vote on
roll call of two-thirds of the members elected to each house, it shall become
a law as provided in this constitution, notwithstanding the governor's
objections. This section shall not apply to emergency measures as referred to
in section 1 of the article on the legislative department.

If any bill be not returned within five days after it shall have been
presented to the governor (Sunday excepted) such bill shall become a law in

adjournment prevents its return, in which case it shall be filed with his
objections in the office of the secretary of state within ten days after such
adjournment (Sundays excepted) or become a law as provided in this

adoption of a bill notwithstanding his objection, it shall be filed with the
secretary of state.

If any bill presented to the governor contains several items of
appropriations of money, he may object to one or more of such items, while
approving other portions of the bill. In such case he shall append to the
bill at the time of signing it, a statement of the item or items which he
declines to approve, together with his reasons therefor, and such item or
items shall not take effect unless passed over the governor's objections as in
this section provided.

The veto power of the governor shall not extend to any bill passed by
the legislature and referred to the people for adoption or rejection.

    commission on salaries for elective state officers

Section 12. The salaries of those holding elective state
offices shall be as established by law from time to time, subject to the
limitations of article 6, section 33 and to the limitations of article 4, part
2, section 17. Such salaries as are presently established may be altered from
time to time by the procedure established in this section or as otherwise
provided by law, except that legislative salaries may be altered only by the
procedures established in this section.

A commission to be known as the commission on salaries for elective
state officers is authorized to be established by the legislature. The
commission shall be composed of five members appointed from private life, two
of whom shall be appointed by the governor and one each by the president of
the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives, and the chief
justice. At such times as may be directed by the legislature, the commission
shall report to the governor with recommendations concerning the rates of pay
of elected state officers. The governor shall upon the receipt of such report
make recommendations to the legislature with respect to the exact rates of pay
which he deems advisable for those offices and positions other than for the
rates of pay of members of the legislature. Such recommendations shall become
effective at a time established by the legislature after the transmission of
the recommendation of the governor without aid of further legislative action
unless, within such period of time, there has been enacted into law a statute
which establishes rates of pay other than those proposed by the governor, or
unless either house of the legislature specifically disapproves all or part of
the governor's recommendation. The recommendations of the governor, unless
disapproved or altered within the time provided by law, shall be effective;
and any 1971 recommendations shall be effective as to all offices on the first
Monday in January of 1973. In case of either a legislative enactment or
disapproval by either house, the recommendations shall be effective only
insofar as not altered or disapproved. The recommendations of the commission
as to legislative salaries shall be certified by it to the secretary of state
and the secretary of state shall submit to the qualified electors at the next
regular general election the question, "Shall the recommendations of the
commission on salaries for elective state officers concerning legislative
salaries be accepted? [ ] Yes [ ] No." Such recommendations if approved by
the electors shall become effective at the beginning of the next regular
legislative session without any other authorizing legislation. All
recommendations which become effective under this section shall supersede all
laws enacted prior to their effective date relating to such salaries.
